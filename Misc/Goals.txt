REQUIREMENTS:
    General
        - As simple and intuitive as possible
        - Put the user into perspective, focus on responsibility
        - Complete usage of local resources while still using efficient code (Threading, etc.)
        - Use lambda expressions where ever possible to increase readability
		- USE THE USING STATEMENT!
        - Fail hard, fail fast
            - Let your code fail fast and hard (instead of swallowing errors) to make sure we can fix the error quickly.
              There's nothing worse than having to peek for the error source because of a swallowed error.
				- Use Contracts for parameter validation instead of if-then-throw / guard clauses.
		- Separation of concerns
			- Each class serves exactly ONE purpose. 
			- Complete your task by creating additional classes for different purposes.
				- Do not hesitate using subclasses or substructs, if necessary.
